**OO Basics**

  Abstraction
  
  Encapsulation
  
  Inheritance
  
  Polymorphism
  

**OO Principles**

  Encapsulate what varies
  
  Favour composition over Inheritance
  
  Program to an interface, not implementations
  

**OO Patterns**

  _**Strategy**_ - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
    interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithms vary independently from them
    clients that use them
    
  _**Template Method**_ - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps
    to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm 
    without changing the algorithm structure
