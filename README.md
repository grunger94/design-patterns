**OO Basics**
  Abstraction
  Encapsulation
  Inheritance
  Polymorphism

**OO Principles**

  Encapsulate what varies
  Favour composition over Inheritance
  Program to an interface, not implementations

**OO Patterns**

  _**Strategy**_ - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
    interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithms vary independently from them
    clients that use them
