**OO Basics**

  Abstraction
  
  Encapsulation
  
  Inheritance
  
  Polymorphism
  

**OO Principles**

  Encapsulate what varies
  
  Favour composition over Inheritance
  
  Program to an interface, not implementations
  
  Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
  
  Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes
  
  Don’t call us, we’ll call you
  

**OO Patterns**

  _**Strategy**_ - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
    interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithms vary independently from them
    clients that use them
    
  _**Factory method**_ - Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
    which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to the
    subclasses
    
  _**Singleton**_ - Ensures a class only has one instance and provide a local point of access to it
    
  _**Template Method**_ - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps
    to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm 
    without changing the algorithm structure
